<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Paracentesis Kit Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Large Volume Removal</li><li>Percutaneous Aspiration</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The paracentesis kit market is categorized into two primary types: large volume removal and percutaneous aspiration. Large volume removal involves extracting significant amounts of fluid from the abdominal cavity, often to relieve pressure or diagnose conditions. Percutaneous aspiration, on the other hand, is a minimally invasive technique used to withdraw smaller volumes of fluid using a needle. Both methods aim to alleviate symptoms and aid in diagnosis, but they differ in their application and volume of fluid extracted.</p></p>
