<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Road Surface Temperature Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active</li><li>Passive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Road Surface Temperature Sensor market is categorized into active and passive types. Active sensors require an external power source to function, actively measuring temperature by emitting signals and analyzing their reflections. These sensors are typically more precise and responsive. In contrast, passive sensors do not need external power, relying on ambient energy to detect temperature changes. They are generally simpler and more cost-effective but may offer less accuracy. Both types play crucial roles in maintaining road safety and optimizing infrastructure management.</p></p>
