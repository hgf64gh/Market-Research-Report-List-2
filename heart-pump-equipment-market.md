<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Heart Pump Equipment Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Implantable Heart Pump Equipment</li><li>Extracorporeal Heart Pump Equipment</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The heart pump equipment market comprises two main types: implantable heart pump equipment and extracorporeal heart pump equipment. Implantable heart pumps, such as left ventricular assist devices (LVADs), are surgically placed inside the body to support heart function in patients with severe heart failure. Extracorporeal heart pumps, on the other hand, are external devices used to temporarily assist cardiac function during surgical procedures or critical care situations, providing short-term support while the heart recovers or until a more permanent solution is found.</p></p>
